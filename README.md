This is a proof of concept for getting the data about rides on a Onewheel from onewheel.com.

You can see it in action here:

https://gizmoware.net/rides/?s=2543436

And you can read more about it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/ztv0hc/hey_techies_lets_make_a_better_ride_sharing/

And note that Google Maps made me remove the API key from index.php, you can get your own key here:

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

And replace the "KEY_REMOVED" text with your key.
